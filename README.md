Hello, world! Reposit Project for DGM1600, Fall 2017

I'm Calysto, and I'm a new student to UVU. I'm eager to enter the Animation & Game Development program, so that I can bring to life all the ideas that have been swimming around in my head ever since I decided to enter the video games industry. Initially, my goal was to be a concept artist for Gearbox Studios in my home state, but as time went on I became more determined to pursue the foundation of my own studio, and recognized that my art alone would not be enough to create a game. So, taking a chance, I decided to swap my Illustration degree for Animation just weeks before the fall semester, and I have had so much fun discovering the process behind my favorite art form.

Growing up, I was interested in video games, but I did not develop a passion to create them until I discovered games like Borderlands, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and later on, Overwatch, and learned to appreciate the love and attention to detail put into each of the series.

In addition to playing video games and making art, I also enjoy fashion and cosmetics - an interest which first sprung from my interest in character design. Prior to my change in degree, I was on the path to becoming an illustrator, and I still love to draw; My favorite subjects to draw are monsters, robots, aliens, and surreal horror. I'm very excited to make some games and new friends along the way!
